# NiiVue Desktop

Niivue Desktop is a cross-platform app for viewing medical imaging data.

It is built using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [Niivue](https://github.com/niivue/niivue).

## Current features

- Load and view volumetric medical imaging data. See supported volume formats [here](https://github.com/niivue/niivue?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-formats)
- View data in 3D, 2D, and simultaneous 2D/3D
- Adjust window/level (contrast), zoom, and pan
- Measure distances

## Planned features

- Load and view medical imaging data in over 30 [formats](https://github.com/niivue/niivue?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-formats) (both volume and surface data)
- Mix volume and surface data in the same view
- Expose powerful drawing tools for annotating and segmenting clinical images (e.g. stroke, tumor, and other pathology)
- Save your scene for archiving or sharing with others
